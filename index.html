			<h1>Case Study: <br />Improve Quality and Relevance of User-Created Content</h1>
			<p>Google Grow Team
</p>
			<time datetime="2017-03-14">May 2015</time>
		</header>
    
		<section>
			<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
			<p>I joined the Google Grow team to solve strategic and content challenges around Google’s Grow and GLearn tools. My task was to partner with stakeholders and team members to define strategy for future development and to support content quality.</p>
      <p>With the goal of ‘Making Google a great place to learn’, I supported the PeopleDev (HR) team in empowering content creators to provide Googlers (employees) with "discoverable, relevant, seamless, and enjoyable" content experiences.
</p>
      <p>Google Grow facilitates internal training, career growth, and cross-functional collaboration for the entire company.  When I joined, the team supported two primary products: </p>
      <p class="tab"><strong>GrowCMS:</strong> A CMS empowering Googlers to promote and share skills and case studies.</p>
      <p class="tab"><strong>GLearn:</strong> An e-learning platform hosting registrations for guided learnings including expert-led courses, webinars, and certifications.</indent></p>

<p>I joined the Google Grow team to solve strategic and content challenges around Google’s Grow and GLearn tools. My task was to partner with stakeholders and team members to define strategy for future development and to support content quality.</p>
		</section>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <h3>Establish Scope of Work and Success Criteria</h3>

			<p>Establishing measures of success at the outset was critical to succeeding in this role. My first priority was determining the project scope and establishing baseline quality.  I was told the platforms were riddled with ROT (redundant, outdated and trivial) content.  I wanted to define ROT in a way a script could do the heavy lifting, and reserve my contractors for special cases when the need for their expertise justified the effort and time that human judgment requires.</p>

<p>Working with stakeholders, we determined that sites on the growCMS and courses posted on gLearn would fall within scope for the content quality clean up. Magnet content (internal job postings) were deemed to be out of scope.</p>

<p>I worked with the contractors who had been doing the cleanup manually to help define redundant, outdated and trivial, asked the developers to run a report to see exactly how much ROT existed and presented findings to the director and key stakeholders. My deck included information on current capabilities, a plan of action to solve for the current scope and long-term strategic recommendations.
The plan that included several smaller projects was approved and I was assigned to manage the 3 contractors help with the cleanup.
</p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <h3>Who has the original blueprint</h3>
		<p>One of the biggest hurdles to improving the platform was that many of the original developers of the platform were no longer with the company. With little documentation or code-consistency and the support of only one dedicated developer who joined after the original development team had left, rebooting development was a much a much bigger challenge than we initially anticipated. Additionally, the program manager who had overseen the original build lacked much of the relevant technical knowledge.</p>
  <h3>Meta-what?</h3>
<p>The Grow platform benefited from robust metrics tracking, but suffered from a dependency on manual tagging without governance or policies. Definitions of tags were loose and not documented. There was no one looking at the metrics so no reports were available. While working with the Metrics and Analytics team, we uncovered a couple of issues that compromised the integrity of the data, but took steps to ensure clean data moving forward. The Metrics and Analytics team was thrilled that we were helping them clean up their data, which was an added bonus.</p>
  
    <h3>Overnight Cleanup Parties - Yay?</h3>
<p>The current team included 3 contractors responsible for providing customer support for Googlers creating learning content.  Cleanup was very manual, slow and error-prone. It was easy to see that it wasn’t for lack of work ethic or knowledge.  The solution was not to work harder, but smarter.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>After 10 months I was able to achieve measurable results in improving the quality of existing content and was making strides towards improving future content.  The content quality team went from answering tickets and providing basic HTML support to  managing a support program through a help desk format, providing guidelines and personalized communications for content improvement, and being the center of excellence for metrics-based program improvements.</p>
      <h3>1. Streamline and manage process for content governance.</h3>
    <ul>
  <li>Reorganize team to support growCMS content management.</li>
  <li>Standardize governance rules and apply content governance strategy.</li>
  <li>Create and manage a support program to content creators with best practice presentation series, a dedicated Help site, and office hours.</li>
  <li>Establish rules to prioritize feature requests</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Result: Reduced resources needed for maintenance</h4>
      

      <h3>2. Content Improvement</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Provide business insight presentations with recommendations based on usage statistics and user feedback</li>
      <li>Automate personalized and scheduled user communications according to business rules</li>
  <li>Create and automate workflow for processing user feedback and escalation</li>
      </ul>
<h4>Result: Improved 1,022 of programs in Grow (~10%); Reduce # of outdated programs in Grow by 5,500 (almost 50%)</h4>
  <h3>3. Provide Business Insights and Solutions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Develop a recommendations engine to serve relevant content to users</li>
<li>Provide operations strategy for on-demand metrics and recommendations 
  Consult on content management systems to other departments</li>
  <li>Provide insights for UX improvements, process improvements, platform improvements</li>
<li>Highlight potential problems and ambiguities related to content quality</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Result: Identified opportunities for continuous improvement of the program.</h4>

<p>I was not able to achieve everything in the Phase 3.  I wanted to establish a taxonomy management platform that would be single source of truth for all the taxonomy and ontology terms for the program.  Having a platform would fuel a recommendation engine I was hoping to build based on users’ past courses or content consumption.</p>

<p>However, I was very pleased with the progress that I made, and came away from my experience at Google feeling like I made a difference.</p>

			<h1>Case Study: <br />Align Campaign and Content Performance Tracking</h1>
			<p>Cisco Marketing Tech Stack Team
</p>
			<time datetime="2017-03-14">Aug 2018</time>
		</header>
    
		<section>
			<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
			<p>The Cisco Marketing Team spanned 5 regions and 7 business units, all tasked with reporting the performance of their digital marketing efforts to their respective leadership.  An internal tool was created a year before by IT and an agency, to assist in the tracking of content and campaign performance.  Under a recent reorg, the tool and the program was moved under the purview of the Marketing Tech Stack team.  The focus of this case study is how I took over as product manager of the tool and positioned it to aid a larger departmental effort that sought to roll up all marketing activities into a common set of departmental initiatives.</p>

<p>This tool was called the OCID Generator (omnichannel ID generator) and consisted of 4 uniquely generated codes:</p>
      <ul>
  <li>CCID - common campaign ID</li>
  <li>OID - offer ID</li>
  <li> DTID - channel ID</li>
  <li>ECID - eloqua ID</li>
      </ul>

<p>There were loose guidelines around when and where to use the IDs. But after a year or so each of the regions and business units implemented the IDs in different ways.</p>

<p>To add additional confusion, there was a legacy way of tracking campaign and content performance called GTM Program Codes.  They were still being used by the Sales team, and .COM for their pages, and many teams were still being measured by those metrics.</p>

<p>There were two different ways to attach codes - by appending the codes to the end of a URL string, or to tag content in the platform it resides in.  No one was entirely sure which way to attach codes to their efforts.  Many things were tagged but were not captured by the metrics team and so were futile, and some codes and tags directly conflicted with one another, resulting in double-counting.  The Metrics 
  
  and Analytics teams were overrun with one-off requests for manual reports and dashboards by the regions and business units. Campaign managers would not understand why some of their efforts were not showing up in the reports, and the Publishing team had been tasked to prioritize work requests without knowing what business initiative was prompting the work coming down the pipeline.</p>
