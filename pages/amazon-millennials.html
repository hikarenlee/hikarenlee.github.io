	<h1>Case Study: <br />Collecting User Data</h1>
	<p>Learning about customers in ways that build trust</p>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>During my time at Amazon, one of my major projects revolved around learning how to collect demographic data from customers. The research I conducted is protected under NDA, so I can't disclose any specifics, but I can share the process and general learnings.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2 id="challenges">The Challenge</h2>
	<p>Some of the obvious solutions for collecting information are to ask for the information on user sign-up, to provide a gift in exchange for the information, or requiring the information in exchange for access to certain features.</p>
	<p>Over the course of my research, I identified 5 key challenges to collecting demographic information from customers and designed solutions to address them.</p>
	<p>The challenges I identified are detailed below.</p>

	<ol>
	<li><a href="#coa">Cost of acquisition</a></li>
	<li><a href="#ia">Information accuracy</a></li>
	<li><a href="#cp">Coverage percentage</a></li>
	<li><a href="#pct">Preserving customer trust</a></li>
	<li><a href="#ocf">Overcoming customer fear</a></li>
	</ol>

	<h3 id="coa">Cost of Acquisition</h3>
	<p>While many companies may see great results in acquiring information like birthdays or ages from customers in exchange for annual birthday gifts, there's actually very little those companies can do to ensure the validity of the information. Case in point, at least one man has 365 registered Starbucks cards, each with a different birthday so he gets a free drink everyday. Not only can this be a very expensive proposition for the company, but it opens a "one-way door" to giving away gifts that can be very difficult to close again.</p>

	<h3 id="ia">Information Accuracy</h3>
	<p>In a similar issue, Facebook (which has been very successful in collecting demographic data) has provided no incentive for truthful information. Even if Facebook were successful in collecting demographic data from 100% of their user base, I would argue that the data they've collected is almost worse than useless. Not only does it cost money to store all of that information, but without incentive to provide truthful answers, the data they have has such a high potential inaccuracy that any conclusions drawn would be suspect at best.</p>

	<h3 id="cp">Coverage Percentage</h3>
	<p>Another challenge is collecting enough customer data to be able to draw meaningful conclusions. Even if you're only interested in the behaviors and habits of a particular demographic, unless you collect data from the majority of your user base, it can be difficult to determine what percentage of your customers in your target demographic you've collected information from.</p>

	<h3 id="pct">Preserving Customer Trust</h3>
	<p>Customers we talked to were very comfortable with the idea of Amazon having their demographic information, but in spite of that, asking for customer information with little or no context made customers feel skeptical and wary. Essentially we found that if customers believed they had volunteered the information as in a profile, that was fine, but when we asked for it, it made them concerned about our intent.</p>

	<h3 id="ocf">Overcoming Customer Fear</h3>
	<p>Beyond concerns about our intent, customers in our studies consistently expressed concerns about being "profiled". Even believing that Amazon could provide them more interesting or relevant results, customers were afraid that we might do so by hiding results that we deemed irrelevant.</p>

	<h2 id="solutions">The Solution</h2>
	<p>To address cost of acquisition, we needed to provide a perceived benefit or value of some sort. This is relatively easy to do for free with digital services, but without a benefit directly related to the information collected, there's still no incentive for customers to provide truthful answers.</p>
	<p>If we're interested in collecting customer birthdays, for example, there's very little we can do to tie a benefit to that. A solution needs to be relatively generic to appeal to a large percentage of the population, but each day of the year is so arbitrary that there's little specific value we can provide - hence the guy with a free "birthday" drink everyday at Starbucks.</p>
	<p>So collecting a birthday is problematic because it can feel like 'sensitive' information and I would guess the majority of cases are really only interested in the year. So, instead trying to do something obvious by tackling birthdays head-on, we could instead just collect the piece we really care about -- age.</p>
	<p>One way to get a person to volunteer their age might be to offer to show them things that other people their age are interested in. While it's true that customers could still lie about their ages, they're more likely to tell you the truth because you've tied the benefit directly to the value they hope to receive.</p>
	<p>If you <i>really</i> need birthday for some reason, then once a customer has provided their age, you can more subtly "nudge" them to provide their birthday -- maybe even just so that their 'age' stays accurate.</p>

	<h2>The Cold-Start Problem</h2>
	<p>Customers feel safe providing their information when there is a clear value associated with it, so offering a tangible, directly-related benefit will always protect customer trust.</p>
	<p>There is an additional challenge that comes up with the 'age' solution above, however, and that is what we call a "cold-start problem".</p>
	<p>The challenge here is simple: until we've collected a substantial amount of customer data, we can't provide meaningful information to the customers.</p>
	<p>Every business that relies on customer input faces this challenge, and there are many ways of overcoming it. It's up to each organization to determine the appropriate solution and pacing for their cold-start problem, but the general approaches come down to either focusing on a single group or grouping everyone together.</p>
	<p>When it comes to grouping everyone, first you might show all people the same results, then later divide the customers into "Over 50" and "Under 50". When you have more data yet, divide ages by decade and so on.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Taking all of these challenges into account and addressing each with your solution can strongly benefit your collected data and help you earn trust with your customers.</p>
	<p>Each interaction your customers have with you contributes to your cumulative relationship. Handle with care.</p>
